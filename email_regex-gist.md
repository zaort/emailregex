# Building a Regular Expression for Matching Email Addresses

Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching in text. In this tutorial, we'll create a regular expression for matching email addresses. We'll go through various components of the regex and explain their roles.

## Summary

The regex we'll be describing is designed to match email addresses. Here's the code snippet of the regex:

^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

This regex ensures that the email address follows the standard format of <username>@<domain>.<tld>.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors, such as ^ and $, mark the start and end of a line, respectively.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers, like + and {2,}, specify the number of occurrences of a character or group.

### Grouping Constructs
Parentheses () are used for grouping parts of the regex together.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, like [a-zA-Z0-9], match any character within the specified range.

### Character Classes
Character classes, such as \. and \@, match specific characters.

### The OR Operator
The OR operator | allows for alternatives within the regex pattern.

### Flags
Flags, like i for case-insensitive matching, modify the behavior of the regex.

### Character Escapes
Character escapes, such as \. and \@, match literal characters rather than their special regex meanings.
